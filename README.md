# Coarse and Sparse Annotations for Segmentation

# Segmenting Skin Biopsy Images with Coarse and Sparse Annotations using U-Net

In this repository, we share the source code of our paper "Segmenting Skin 
Biopsy Images with Coarse and Sparse Annotations using U-Net" SUbmitted to the 
Special Issue on Image Analysis in Dermatology 2021. Abstract below:
 
"The number of melanoma diagnoses has increased dramatically over the past three decades, 
outpacing almost all other cancers. Nearly 1 in 4 skin biopsies are of melanocytic lesions, 
highlighting the clinical and public health importance of correct diagnosis. 
Deep learning image analysis methods may improve and complement current diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. 
Semantic segmentation of clinically important structures in skin biopsies is a 
crucial step towards an accurate diagnosis. While training a segmentation model 
requires ground truth labels, annotation of large images is a labor-intensive task. 
This issue becomes especially pronounced in a medical image dataset in which 
expert annotation is the gold standard. In this paper, we propose a two-stage 
segmentation pipeline using coarse and sparse annotations on a small region of 
the whole slide image as the training set. Segmentation results on whole slide 
images show promising performance for the proposed pipeline."
